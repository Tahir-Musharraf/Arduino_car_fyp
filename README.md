# Arduino_car_fyp
FYP: A car can move left, right, forward and backward by using android application.  In the application we have a screen showing camera outputs (RAW) if anything infront of it comes up like water, fire, wall it will speak louadly 'water, water water' etc. and then the application will automatically stops the vehicle if you don't take any action
# Overview
In today’s world, everything is slowly interconnected via IoT. Android is one of the best and 
biggest platforms for the development and connecting of IoT devices. We’ll use an Arduino 
board with an L298N motor driver to control DC motors. The input will be given by the Android 
Application. It will not be controlled by remote control nor will it be controlled locally but it will 
be controlled through the internet. The connection between Android application and Arduino 
board in the way that firstly we will connect Arduino board to Internet built Wi-Fi function then 
Internet make connection between server and then server connected with Android application. 
The advantage of this is that we can take live feed from the car to an Android application during 
this duration there will be no delay. We can control it from anywhere because it will connected 
to the internet (No range of wifi because it will connected to the internet) and internet make a 
connection between server and server will already be connected with Android application. So 
by using the Android application, it will give inputs and based on these inputs, the device can 
control its speed and rotate left or right depending on the input signals. With the help of the 
Android application can communicate to the Arduino and make riding decisions without wires 
and the communication will be wireless and secured
